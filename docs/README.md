# Differential Equations Documentation

`differential-equations` is a Rust library for solving various types of differential equations. The library is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and efficient.

## Available Modules

- [Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)](./ode/introduction.md) - Tools for solving initial value problems with various numerical methods

## Planned Modules

In the future, this library may include:
- Partial Differential Equations (PDE)
- Finite Element Method (FEM)
- Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE)
- Delay Differential Equations (DDE)

## Installation

To use `differential-equations` in your Rust project, add it as a dependency using `cargo`:

```sh
cargo add differential-equations
```
