# Contributing to Differential Equations

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Differential Equations library! This project aims to build a comprehensive, high-performance suite of differential equation solvers for the Rust ecosystem. Your contributions are vital to help make this vision a reality.

## Todo List

If you're looking for ways to contribute, here are some areas where we could use help. In addition if you have ideas to create a pull request to add more.

### Add Differential Equation Types
- [ ] Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs)
- [ ] Stochastic Delay Differential Equations (SDDEs)
- Add more if you have ideas!

### New Numerical Methods
- [ ] Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF)

### Numerical Method Equation support
- Add support for DDEs for the following solver types
   - [ ] Implicit Runge-Kutta

## Coding Guidelines

- Follow Rust's official style guidelines
- Write comprehensive documentation for public API items
- Include tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before submitting your code
